                        Last Updated on October 11, 2023
                        I don’t know about you, but when the weather turns colder and the holidays start to approach, it makes me want to fire up my oven and bake cookies, pies, and bread and other family favorites.
                        
                        I have had the same baking sheets over 10 years and they’re in really rough shape. I’m in need of a few replacements, and during my research, I learned that some bake sheets contain PFAS.
                        PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, can be found in non-stick cookware (and that includes bakeware), along with food packaging, firefighting foam, household items, outdoor gear that’s “water repellent”. We’ll discuss why this is problematic below, but switching to non-toxic bakeware is one way you can reduce your exposure.
                        Today, more than 97% of the U.S. population has PFAS in their bodies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
                        According to a study released by the USGS, nearly half of US tap water, from both public utilities and private wells, contains forever chemicals.
                        So I try to limit any unnecessary exposure and here are some of the best bakeware brands I came across during my research. All these brands are naturally non-stick without the use of PFAs.

                        <p>Bea Johnson is the 21st Century's zero-waste movement's origin story. The internet simply states that she is a writer and motivational speaker but Bea is nothing short of a downright zero-waste rockstar- can you tell that I'm a huge fan?!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Bea's Zero Waste Movement blog turned best-selling book kicks butt in two ways: it teaches people how to reduce waste and busts myths around waste reduction being expensive, time-consuming, and difficult. By educating people on the how-tos of zero-waste living and dispelling harmful mistruths, Bea gives people the information (and nudge) needed to maintain a greener life.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As a zero-waste newbie, I was first drawn to Bea's biggest flex: reducing her family's annual trash to a single pint. I love that her writing is sharply written, often packing a witty punch while never ceasing to educate and inspire.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>While Bea's blog is a weekly read, I recommend her book Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying Your Life by Reducing Your Waste, where she has condensed her wisdom on waste reduction and green living.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Founder and author Chef Anne-Marie Bonneau offers tips and tricks in the kitchen and beyond, but it's the Zero Waste Chef for the recipes that I ADORE. Anne-Marie proves that the "good" in "good cooking" can come from ethical, zero-waste culinary creations. I love that I can rely on her recipes to feed myself or impress guests and with no expense to the environment.</p>
              <br>
              <p>She also educates readers on how to create a zero-waste kitchen space and think about food from a new perspective. I have changed how I see meal planning and approach my meals with more creativity and consideration. Her resources on going plastic-free were life-changing and I'll use her tricks on zero-waste hosting forever.</p>

                  <p>Morgane Beernaert is a realist. She showed me that "zero-waste" can be a clumsy way of putting things because "zero-waste,” as a concept, is impossible. Managing your expectations can profoundly affect how we approach ethical living, and Morgane taught me to shift my attitude from the intimidating quest for perfect "zero-waste" to a more approachable "low waste" mindset.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>if I had to use one word to describe Zero Waste Nest is would be: helpful. From her fun and whimsical guides on zero-waste fashion to her recommendations on podcasts, books, and documentaries, Morgane has become the little voice in my head helping me live life with a little more style, consideration, and mindfulness.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Their blog and online presence have garnered an impressive following thanks to the couple's informative articles, zero-waste shopping maps, waste-reducing challenges, and how-tos that add community and support to what often feels like a daunting, lonely journey. Their grocery shop breakdown in particular really helped me make more informed and conscientious choices when doing my weekly shop and have helped me save money and the planet.</p>

        <p>I like a no-fuss approach to zero-waste. It's very easy to throw a recycled ribbon on it and call it a day, but one's zero-waste journey is not always glamorous, and seeing someone's raw and transparent journey makes one's transition more approachable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shia and her husband Hanno speak my language with a minimalist approach to zero-waste - Wasteland Rebel. I love her simple (and oh so delicious) recipes and swap-out suggestions for a house and lifestyle more aligned with waste management and eco-friendly consumerism.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She doesn't cut corners with her research either, and her somewhat academic approach distills her sage wisdom into digestible information with actionable steps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shia quickly starts to feel like a friend and one you can trust to tell you the truth. I particularly love her interactive map on her favorite zero-waste blogs. I often consult her DIY recipes for house and beauty products for myself and gifts for loved ones.</p>
